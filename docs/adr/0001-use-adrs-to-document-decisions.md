* Technical Story: N/A

## Context and Problem Statement

The project is evolving and needs a structured way to record architectural and design decisions. Without a clear record, the knowledge about *why* certain choices were made is lost over time, making maintenance, onboarding new team members, and future decision-making difficult. We need a lightweight and effective way to create a "learning history" for the project.

## Decision Drivers

* The need to maintain a clear history of technical decisions.
* The importance of understanding the context and alternatives considered for each decision.
* To facilitate communication and alignment within the team.
* To reduce the onboarding time for new developers.

## Considered Options

* **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** Short, focused documents that record an architectural decision.
* **Wiki/Confluence:** Maintain architecture documentation on a central wiki page.
* **Extensive Design Documents:** Create detailed documents for each new feature or change.
* **No formal record:** Rely on team memory and verbal communication.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**", because it is a lightweight, focused approach that integrates well with the development workflow (ADRs can be versioned along with the code). They provide the necessary context without the overhead of extensive documents.

### Positive Consequences

* Creates a clear and immutable historical record of decisions.
* Improves long-term architectural consistency.
* Facilitates the review of past decisions.

### Negative Consequences

* Requires discipline from the team to create and maintain ADRs.
* There might be a small initial overhead to write the document.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

* **Good:** Lightweight, versionable with the code, focused on a single decision, easy to consult.
* **Bad:** Requires discipline to be maintained.

### Wiki/Confluence

* **Good:** Collaborative tool, easy to edit.
* **Bad:** Can become outdated easily, is not versioned with the code, can become disorganized.

### Extensive Design Documents

* **Good:** Very detailed, covers all aspects of a change.
* **Bad:** Time-consuming to write and read, prone to becoming outdated, overkill for most decisions.

### No formal record

* **Good:** No overhead.
* **Bad:** Knowledge is lost, decisions are made without context, high risk of inconsistencies.
